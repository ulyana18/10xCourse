# Product Requirements Document (PRD) â€“ 10x-cards

## 1. Product Overview
The 10x-cards project aims to enable users to efficiently create and manage educational flashcard sets. The application leverages LLM models (via API) to generate flashcard suggestions based on provided text input.

## 2. User Problem
Creating high-quality flashcards manually requires significant time and effort, which discourages users from adopting the effective learning method of spaced repetition. The solution aims to reduce the time needed to create appropriate questions and answers while simplifying the process of managing study materials.

## 3. Functional Requirements
1. Automated Flashcard Generation:
   - Users can paste any text (e.g., textbook excerpt).
   - Application sends text to LLM model through API.
   - LLM model suggests a set of flashcards (questions and answers).
   - Flashcards are presented to users in a list format with options to accept, edit, or reject.

2. Manual Flashcard Creation and Management:
   - Form for manual flashcard creation (front and back).
   - Options to edit and delete existing flashcards.
   - Manual creation and display within "My Flashcards" view.

3. Basic Authentication and User Accounts:
   - Registration and login functionality.
   - Option to delete account and associated flashcards upon request.

4. Spaced Repetition Integration:
   - Implementation of flashcard scheduling mechanism (using existing algorithm).
   - MVP excludes additional metadata and advanced notification features.

5. Storage and Scalability:
   - Flashcard and user data stored in a scalable and secure manner.

6. Flashcard Generation Statistics:
   - Tracking information about AI-generated flashcards and their acceptance rate.

7. Legal Requirements and Limitations:
   - User personal data and flashcards stored in compliance with GDPR.
   - Right to access and delete data (account with flashcards) upon user request.

## 4. Product Boundaries
1. Outside MVP Scope:
   - Advanced, proprietary spaced repetition algorithm (using existing open-source solution).
   - Gamification features.
   - Mobile applications (web version only).
   - Multiple document format imports (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
   - Public API access.
   - Flashcard sharing between users.
   - Advanced notification system.
   - Complex flashcard keyword search.
